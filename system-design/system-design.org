#+title: System Design Notes

* Computers only understand 0 and 1
This needs to be stored somewhere
** They can be stored in an HDD or an SSD ( a faster option )
** Another way to store it is in the RAM or the primary memory
*** Volatile - The data wont be persisted
** Cache
*** Faster than RAM, there is L1, L2 and L3

* High Level Architecture of a Production-Ready Application
1. CI/CD pipeline
   - Ensures the code goes through a series of tests and checks
   - GH action and Jenkins
2. Load Balancer
   - Ensures the application servs many users in situations of high traffic
3. Storage
4. Logging and Monitoring
   - Sentry or PM2
5. Alerting Service

* Good Design Principles
1. Scalability
2. Maintainability
3. Efficiency
4. Reliability

* Three Key Elements of Data Storage
1. Moving Data
2. Storing Data
3. Transforming Data
