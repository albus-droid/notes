*** UNIX History
- C developed by Dennis Ritchie
- UNIX was developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie *1969*
- Initially it was written in ASM, but later ported to C *1973*

- Two emerges - *BSD* and *System-V*
- BSD - TCP/IP Stack and NFS
- Linus Torvlads develops the Linux Kernel for GNUa *1991*

- Why did Linux get so popular then? Maybe due to the lawsuits happening at the time because of BSD software
- Solaris - ZFS, dtrace and even containers

*** Licenses
- BSD: Make modifications, can be released as closed-source, but just to have to credit the creators
- GPL: Make modifications, can only be released under the same license, so only open-source and not closed-source

*** Trivia
**** Some bash commands I found really helpful
	1. Last argument of previous command
		#+BEGIN_SRC bash
		/command/ !$
		#+END_SRC

	2. All args of previous command
		#+BEGIN_SRC bash
		/command/ !*
		#+END_SRC

	3. Word count of all .c and .h files in a folder
		#+BEGIN_SRC bash
		wc -l *.[ch]
		#+END_SRC
